## Overview

Pagination is a crucial aspect of managing and presenting large datasets efficiently. In here we
 start our exploration into pagination, breaking up large pieces of data into manageable portion
s. We've implemented different implementations to completely understand the concept. 

## How Pagination Works

1. **Endpoint Integration:**
   - Pagination is seamlessly integrated into relevant API endpoints.
   - Use query parameters such as `page` and `pageSize` to navigate through results.

2. **Efficient Data Retrieval:**
   - Retrieve only the data required for the current page, optimizing performance.
   - Specify the page number (`page`) and the number of items per page (`pageSize`) to customize results.

3. **Example Usage:**
   ```http
   GET /api/data?pageSize=10&page=2
   ```
   This request fetches the second page of data, with 10 items per page.
